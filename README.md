# stock-analysis
## Overview

This analysis was done to help show Steve how twelve specific stocks performed in 2017 and 2018. The analysis is broken down by stock and returns total daily volume as well as the rate of return for a specified year to show Steve the performance for that year. This will help Steve make a more educated decision on which stocks to add to his parents’ portfolio.

##Results

Looking at the data, the selected stocks performed much better in 2017 as compared to 2018. In 2017, eleven of the twelve stocks had a positive rate of return as opposed to only two being positive in 2018. Based on this, the two that were green for both years would be the obvious choices to add to the portfolio, while it would probably be a good idea to avoid TERP, the only stock that had a negative performance for both years. 
Before refactoring, the code ran in 9/10ths of a second, as opposed to running in about 2/10ths of a second or less after.

##Summary

Refactoring code has several advantages including, but not limited to, faster performance, improved legibility that allows the code to be understood and worked on by other programmers, and a better code that makes maintenance of the software easier. When refactoring, it is always possible that new errors are written into the code, which is why it’s important to always test your code to ensure it runs properly.
The original code was fine for the number of lines that were needed to loop through in this analysis as it took about 9/10ths of a second to perform the analysis but would not be practical for a much larger analysis. Refactoring the code helped it run in a quarter of the time and made the general experience much smoother for the end user. While it may be a little more difficult for someone who has very little coding experience to work on, it is a much cleaner-looking code.
